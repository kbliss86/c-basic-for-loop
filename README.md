# Basic For Loops Lab

## Description:
Create a program that prompts the user to enter a number. The program will then use a `for-loop` to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 up to the number entered by the user.

## Example:


## Task:
1. Prompt the user to enter a number.
2. Use a `for-loop` to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to the number entered by the user.
3. After displaying the result, ask the user if they would like to continue. If yes, repeat the process. If no, exit the program and display "Goodbye!".

## Build Specifications:
- Implement a for-loop to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to the userâ€™s input.
- Ensure proper user input handling and output formatting.
- Continue looping until the user decides to exit the program.

## Additional Requirements:
- Keep the user experience friendly and the output clear.

## Hints:
- Remember that a `for-loop` can handle this problem efficiently. Make sure to sum each number properly within the loop.
